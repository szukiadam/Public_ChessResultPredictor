# Baselines

## Intuition
1. Enables rapid experimentation via hyperparam tuning
1. Discovery of data issues, false assumptions, bugs
1. Pareto's principal (achieve decent performance with minimal initial effort)

## Process
1. Start with simplest possible baseline (most often random chance)
1. Develop a rule based approach
1. Slowly add complexity 
1. Weigh tradeoffs between performant baselines
1. Revisit and iterate on baselines as your dataset grows

## Tradeoffs to consider
    1. interpretability: does your model to explain its predictions?
    1. bias checks: does your model pass them?

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. goal is to **convince** yourself that the data you have is sufficient for the task 
1. use EDA to answer important questions and to make it easier to extract insights
1. not a one time process - as your data grows, you want to revisit your EDA

# Project structure

1. Recommends VSCode
